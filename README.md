## Brunel City Airport ##

For our first-year project, a group of 8 students developed this project. In order to complete this project, 
our team had to collaborate to create a working piece of software that enabled users to make flight reservations.

I was given the assignment to complete the passenger component as a member of the group.

### My objective was as follwoing: ###
----
- [x] The passenger data input must be for a number of passengers equal to the number of tickets and airplane
seats selected. The user should input each passengerâ€™s first name, surname, date of birth, telephone number,
email, number of bags the passenger wants to check in, which departing seat they have chosen out of all the
selected departure flight seats as well as which returning seat they have chosen out of all the selected return
flight seats.
- [x] Each passenger should only be able to select one seat out of all of the selected seats for the departure flight.
Likewise, each passenger should only be able to select one seat out of all of the selected seats for the return
flight.
- [x] A random ticket number of length 8 must be created and stored for each passenger i.e for each round trip
made by each passenger.
- [x] Error handling needs to be included as well as an interface that is clear and easy to use
